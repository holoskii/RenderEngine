# Render Engine Demo
This project is a demo of software render engine. Main goal was to try out mathematical transformations that are used to create 2d image from 3d polygons. It does not use any external libraries for rendering, the only library used is SFML - for window managing and triangles drawing. Camera movent is also possible: W/S - Forward/Backward, A/D - turn Left/Right, Shift/Ctrl - Up/Down.
